    <h1>Full Stack Web Development Tech Stack</h1>
    <p>A tech stack refers to a set of tools, programming languages, and technologies that work together to build digital products or solutions such as websites, mobile, and web apps. <br> A tech stack consists of two equally important elements: the frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side). Both work together to create a working tech stack. This is also referred to as an application stack.</p>

It's a programming language that allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages; with common libraries and frameworks like jQuery, React, Angular, and Vue. Many modern applications now also use TypeScript instead of basic JavaScript.</dd>

        <dd>Programming languages - This creates logic for apps and websites. The code link the web to a database. Some examples are JavaScript, PHP, and Python.</dd>
        <dd>Frameworks - it provides support of applications based on a single programming language. Laravel, Django, and Ruby on Rails are few of the popular frameworks. Most modern applications are built using an MVC style framework.</dd>
        <dd>Web Servers - You need backend servers to manage client requests. Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS) are the most common web servers.</dd>
        <dd>Databases - Most applications require a SQL or NoSQL database. MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and MySQL are common databases.</dd>
