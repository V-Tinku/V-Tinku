HTML Class Names using BEM

1. The first paragraph is assigned the class name paragraph. This represents a block-level element.

2. The second paragraph is assigned the class name paragraph paragraph--important. Here: paragraph represents the block-level element.
paragraph--important is a modifier class that indicates this paragraph is of special importance.

3. The third paragraph is assigned the class name paragraph paragraph__note. Here: paragraph represents the block-level element.
paragraph__note indicates that this is an element within the paragraph block, specifically a note.

CSS Styling using class selectors

1. The base styles for all paragraphs are defined using the .paragraph class selector.

2. The .paragraph--important class selector is used to apply modifier styles to important paragraphs, making the text bold and red.

3. The .paragraph__note class selector is used to apply element styles to notes within paragraphs, making the text italic and changing its color.
