    <h1>2nd October, 2023</h1>
    <p><b>Gandhi Jayanti</b> is an event celebrated in India to mark the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi. It is celebrated annually on 2 October, and is one of the three national holidays of India. The UN General Assembly announced on 15 June 2007 that it adopted a resolution which declared that 2 October will be celebrated as the International Day of Non-Violence as he was a non-violent freedom fighter. He is also known as the "Father of The Nation" and this title was given to him by Subhas Chandra Bose for his relentless struggles for independence.</p>
