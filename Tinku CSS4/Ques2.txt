
1. justify-content:
   - Role: This property determines how flex items are positioned along the main axis of the flex container.
   - Values:
     - flex-start: Items are packed at the start of the container.
     - flex-end: Items are packed at the end of the container.
     - center: Items are centered within the container.
     - space-between: Items are evenly distributed with equal space between them.
     - space-around: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around them.
     - space-evenly: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around and between them.
   - Example: justify-content: center; will center the flex items along the main axis of the container.

2. align-items:
   - Role: This property determines how flex items are aligned within the cross-axis of the flex container.
   - Values:
     - flex-start: Items are aligned at the start of the cross-axis.
     - flex-end: Items are aligned at the end of the cross-axis.
     - center: Items are centered within the cross-axis.
     - baseline: Items are aligned based on their text baselines.
     - stretch: Items are stretched to fill the container's cross-axis.
   - Example: align-items: center; will center the flex items along the cross-axis of the container.

3. gap (or row-gap and column-gap in the context of grid layout):
   - Role: This property sets the space or gap between flex items in a flex container. 
           It's particularly useful for adding spacing between items without the need for additional margin or padding.
   - Example: gap: 10px; will create a 10-pixel gap between adjacent flex items.

4. flex-direction:
   - Role: This property defines the direction in which flex items are laid out within the flex container.
   - Values:
     - row: Items are arranged in a horizontal line (default).
     - row-reverse: Items are arranged horizontally in reverse order.
     - column: Items are arranged in a vertical line.
     - column-reverse: Items are arranged vertically in reverse order.
   - Example: flex-direction: column; will arrange the flex items vertically.

5. flex-wrap:
   - Role: This property controls whether flex items should wrap to a new line when there's not enough space in the flex container.
   - Values:
     - nowrap (default): Items are not allowed to wrap, and they may overflow the container.
     - wrap: Items are allowed to wrap onto new lines if necessary.
     - wrap-reverse: Items wrap in the reverse order if they overflow.
   - Example: flex-wrap: wrap; allows flex items to wrap to a new line when the container's width is insufficient.
