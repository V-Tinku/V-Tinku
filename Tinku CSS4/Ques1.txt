Flexbox: Flexbox, or the Flexible Box Layout, is designed for arranging items along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically) and is well-suited for creating flexible and
dynamic layouts within a single container. It is ideal for creating components like navigation menus, buttons, or distributing space-efficiently in one dimension. Flexbox is designed 
to easily reorder and reposition items within the container along the main axis, making it useful for reordering content in response to different screen sizes or user interactions.

Grid: Grid, or the CSS Grid Layout, is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to create complex, grid-based layouts with rows and columns. It is great for aligning and 
positioning items in both horizontal and vertical dimensions and excels in creating structured and grid-like layouts for web pages. Grid can also change the order of items 
but is more oriented towards maintaining a structured grid layout. It's better for preserving the natural order of content.


When to Choose One Over the Other:

Choose Flexbox when you need to align and distribute items along a single axis. 
It's perfect for creating flexible and responsive components like navigation bars, buttons, or flexible card layouts.

Choose Grid when you need to create complex, grid-based layouts with both rows and columns. 
It's particularly useful for designing page layouts, such as the main structure of a webpage with headers, sidebars, and content areas.
