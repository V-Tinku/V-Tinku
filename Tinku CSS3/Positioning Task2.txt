it will be positioned relative to where it would have been if it were not moved. Other elements in the document flow still occupy their original positions.

Absolute Positioning: When you use absolute positioning for an element, it is positioned relative to its nearest ancestor with a position property other than "static" (usually relative, 
absolute, or fixed). This means it's taken out of the normal document flow, and its position is determined based on its nearest positioned ancestor, which can lead to elements overlapping 
if not managed carefully. Other elements don't consider the absolute positioned element when determining their positions.
