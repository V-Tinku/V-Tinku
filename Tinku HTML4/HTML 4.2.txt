HTML entities are special codes used in HTML to represent characters and symbols that have special meaning or might not be easily entered directly using a keyboard. Here are five commonly used HTML entities:

1. '&lt;' - Represents the less-than sign '<'.

2. '&gt;' - Represents the greater-than sign '>'.

3. '&amp;' - Represents the ampersand '&'.

4. '&quot;' - Represents the double quotation mark '"'.

5. '&apos;' - Represents the apostrophe or single quotation mark `'`.

HTML entities are essential for displaying reserved characters and symbols correctly in web pages, ensuring that they are not interpreted as part of the HTML markup.
