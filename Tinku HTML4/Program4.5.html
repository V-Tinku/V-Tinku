        <h1>HTML 5</h1>
        <dl>
            <dt>HTML5, the fifth revision of the Hypertext Markup Language, introduced several key features and improvements for web development. Here are three of its most notable features:</dt>
            <dd> <b>Semantic Elements:</b> HTML5 introduced a set of new semantic elements that help developers better structure web content. These elements provide clear and meaningful tags to describe the purpose of different parts of a web page. Some examples include &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, and &lt;figure&gt;. Using these elements makes it easier for search engines to understand the content and enhances accessibility for users with disabilities.</dd>
            <dd> <b>Audio and Video Support:</b> HTML5 includes native support for embedding audio and video content directly into web pages using the &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; elements. This eliminates the need for third-party plugins like Adobe Flash or Java applets, making it easier to deliver multimedia content to a wide range of devices and browsers. HTML5 also introduced the ability to play media content without requiring a specific codec or plugin, thanks to the &lt;source&gt; element, which allows developers to specify multiple formats for compatibility across different platforms.</dd>
            <dd><b>Canvas and SVG Graphics:</b> HTML5 introduced the &lt;canvas&gt; element, which allows developers to draw and manipulate graphics, animations, and interactive content directly within the web page using JavaScript. This feature is particularly useful for creating games, data visualizations, and other dynamic graphics. Additionally, HTML5 includes improved support for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), which allows for the creation of vector graphics that scale smoothly and can be easily styled and animated with CSS and JavaScript.</dd>
        </dl>
        <footer>These three features, among others, have contributed to HTML5's popularity and its role in modern web development, enabling more interactive and multimedia-rich websites while also improving the structure and accessibility of web content.</footer>
