Improving the accessibility of HTML and web content is essential for ensuring that all users can access and interact with your website or web application. Here are three key ways to enhance accessibility in HTML:

1. Use Semantic HTML Elements:
   - Utilize semantic HTML elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, and <footer> to provide a clear and meaningful structure to your content. These elements help screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the organization of your page.
   - Choose appropriate HTML elements for their intended purposes. For example, use `<button>` elements for clickable buttons, <a> elements for links, and <input> elements with the appropriate 'type' attribute for form controls.

2. Provide Descriptive Alt Text for Images:
   - Include descriptive alternative text (alt text) for images using the alt attribute within <img> elements. Alt text should convey the purpose and content of the image.
   - Use empty 'alt' attributes (alt="") for purely decorative images that don't convey meaningful content or function.

3. Implement Keyboard Accessibility:
   - Ensure that all interactive elements and functionality can be accessed and used via keyboard navigation. This includes forms, buttons, links, and interactive widgets.
   - Use the 'tabindex' attribute to specify a logical order for keyboard navigation through interactive elements.
   - Implement keyboard event handlers to handle keyboard interactions, such as focus management and triggering actions when the Enter or Space key is pressed.
